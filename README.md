# ME499: Exploring Autonomous Vehicles
Repo for our ME499 Exploring Autonomous Vehicles Project

The bulk of this repo contains files for our computer vision project. This projects relies on a 1:10 scale RC buggy outfitted with a Raspberry Pi 3B and Pi camera for navigating hallways. We seek to build on our prior expereince with autonmous driving, using GPS and compass data, by exploring computer vision and machine learning algorithms.
